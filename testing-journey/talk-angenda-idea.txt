my journey in testing

testing is an automation to make sure your programm works properly
sounds simple but it's not.
It's more a journey

Why testing uncel bob
- have responcibility
- no regulation from law yet

Where did I start at my first company
- no automated testing
- testen as clicking throughthe most important app featuers
- the client was the real tester

[More s short screen animation with an simple record creation and an error page (better erros would be nice)]

In new york
- learning ruby
- learning tdd
- clean code

[simple test example from maybe railsbook]

Why testing is good
- have faith in your code during refactoring
- no need to click throughyour app manually

But now so many big words
- tdd
- integration tests
- unit tests
- feature tests

- Reading reading Reading

One thing I still got confused it tdd and bdd

- talk with snuggsi
